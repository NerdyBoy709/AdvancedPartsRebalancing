I initially made this patch for my own use in my KSP playthrough , but then I thought others might also find patch like this useful so im sharing it.
It cointains mostly rebalancing patches for some mods i use often (FFT , Near Future , KARE ect )
Additionally, it significantly buffs all system heat radiators.
